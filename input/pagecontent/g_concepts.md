* The list of the concepts , definitions and mappings are in a central, managed repository.
"Managed" means, in short, thereâ€™s a status and responsible
* Concepts are referenced by their identifier. Concepts can have different identifiers (e.g. via mappings)
* New concepts can be created:
* Authors should consult the core dictionary to see if a concept is defined. If a concept exists and is approved, it can be used in the topic dictionary without further approval.
* Approval is done by a dedicated entity, onboarding concepts into the common dictionary, verifying overlaps, duplicates...
* Publication cannot be done where there are concepts that are not approved - will be a QA issue
* Concepts can also be onboarded from existing reference dictionaries, e.g. ICD-11 or IPS
  * The onboarding process is the same - at the end, all concepts have one key identifier and are thus part of the common dictionary
