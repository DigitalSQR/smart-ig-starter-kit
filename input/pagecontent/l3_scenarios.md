Scenarios are uniquely identified "example stories" that describe how the system is expected to behave in a relatively concrete scenario. 

### **Inputs:** 

* L2 scenarios in narrative form


### **Outputs:**

* ExampleScenarios in `input/resource/scenarios`


### **Activities:**

* Check input scenarios - the L2 should contain identifiable, well-defined and well-delimited scenario descriptions. these should be rather concrete - i.e. not high abstractions, but concrete to a specific context.
* Develop ExampleScenario resources 
  - TO DO: we should have SUSHI RuleSets for this resource
  - TO DO: This deserves some data generation feature.



### **Output Criteria / Definition of Done:**

* ExampleScenarios should be validated by the publisher and possibly reviewed by the L2 author



### **Issues:**

### **Tooling**
